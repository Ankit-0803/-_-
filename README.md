This repository showcases machine learning projects completed during my internship at CodeAlpha. The projects explore various machine learning techniques across different fields.<br>
Credit Scoring Model<br>
The credit scoring model predicts the creditworthiness of individuals using a variety of features, including demographic, financial, and behavioral data. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques and evaluated on its accuracy, precision, and recall.<br>
Handwritten Character Recognition<br>
The Handwritten Character Recognition project aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize handwritten characters from images. This has practical applications in fields like digitization of handwritten documents, automated form reading, and postal code recognition in mail sorting systems.<br>
Disease Prediction from Medical Data<br>
The Disease Prediction from Medical Data project is developed to aid in the early diagnosis of diseases by analyzing patient medical records and clinical data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project predicts the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or chronic kidney disease. Early prediction can assist healthcare professionals in providing timely treatment and improving patient outcomes.
